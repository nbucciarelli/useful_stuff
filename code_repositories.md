# contracts.ruby
contracts.ruby brings code contracts to the Ruby language. Code contracts allow you make some assertions about your code, and then checks them to make sure they hold. This lets you:
- catch bugs faster
- make it very easy to catch certain types of bugs
- make sure that the user gets proper messaging when a bug occurs.
